## Hi Stranger🧸

### 🐈 Here's A Lot About Me
👩🏻‍💻 I'm Victoria Tran, a data analyst in tech who uses: ![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Python-3776AB?logo=python&logoColor=white) ![SQL](https://img.shields.io/badge/-SQL-003B57?logo=database&logoColor=white) ![R](https://img.shields.io/badge/-R-276DC3?logo=r&logoColor=white) ![Microsoft Power BI](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Power%20BI-F2C811?logo=powerbi&logoColor=black) to drive data-driven decisions.

🦦 Outside of work, I volunteer at cat rescues while developing my business knowledge.

📚 I used to hate reading. Now, I enjoy reading books about **personal development** and **financial literacy**.

🐈‍⬛ My favorite animal is a cat. I have a 16-year-old kitty who was rescued from an alleyway and remains ungrateful.

☃️ My least favourite season is winter. During this time of year, you won't see me leaving my home. 

🧋 My go-to order *was* the CoCo's roasted milk tea with 30% sugar, less ice, and tapioca (obviously), but it’s officially been discontinued.

🐙 Made it this far? If you’re curious about more, feel free to reach out.
